# Uninitialized State Error in React Native

This repository demonstrates a common error in React Native: accessing state variables before they are initialized. The `bug.js` file contains code that reproduces this error, while `bugSolution.js` provides a solution.

## Problem

Accessing state variables in React Native components before they are initialized leads to undefined behavior. This frequently happens during asynchronous operations, where data isn't immediately available.

## Solution

The solution involves ensuring state is initialized before accessing it. This can be done by making sure asynchronous operations are complete before trying to access the result, using conditional rendering or loading states, or by setting default values in the state.
